# NetworkTrafficManagement-SDN

This project is to detect congestion in Software Defined Networking. The network is established in mini-net environment and flows are modified to establish congestion. The statistics are monitored in wireshark and then the data is preprocesses to get trends to avoid over-fitting. The model is trained and is used to predict.

This model needs to be extended for more possibilities of congestion and network traffic intrusion. Then another model should be built to alter the flows in the network.
